Reading input
Writing output

logical operators 
functions
    -basic recursion(a function calling itself)
arrays
    - multidimensional arrays

# getting started is showing me some resources to read and also will expose me to bronze level problem from usaco.

# so there are 4 variables in this question, a b c d.

        # a,b,x,y  = map(int, input().split())
        # ans1, ans2, ans3 = 0,0,0

        # '''
        # so there are 3 possibilities
        # 1. directly from start to end
        # 2. takes one side of the portal --> a to x to y to b
        # 3. takes the other side of the portal --> a to y to x to b
        # '''

        # #first case
        # ans1 = abs(b-a)
        # ans2 = abs(x-a) + abs(y-b)
        # ans3 = abs(y-a) + abs(x-b)

        # ans = min(ans1, ans2, ans3)
        # print(ans)
